# Beat Saber - Claws v1.3.0

Gameplay modifier that shrinks sabers by 70% (from 1m to 0.3m) & alters grip.

Thanks to [ragesaq](https://twitch.tv/ragesaq) for giving me the original mod and idea for this gamemode!

## How to Play

1. Install "Claws" using [ModAssistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant), or [download the latest version](https://github.com/SteffanDonal/BeatSaber-Claws/releases) and unzip manually.
2. In the gameplay settings, under mods, find the "Claws" toggle and enable it!

The default saber adjustments that come with Claws are setup for Touch, Rift S, WMR & Index.

### Safety

Claws is hard. Harder than it looks, and it _looks_ hard.

**Please warmup thoroughly before playing Claws**. As someone who has been playing Claws for over 500 hours now, a warmup is _necessary_. Stretch your arms and shoulders, and try not to overuse your elbows or wrists. Take breaks!

Also take extra care not to controller smash 🤣

## Community

[Join my Discord](http://claws.ruirize.co.uk) to chat & share great Claws maps!

[Versus Mod](https://versusmod.com/Help) supports Claws! It's a mod that allows you to scorechase with friends and challenge streamers. When you play with Claws, your scores will only be compared with other Clores Scaws. 😉  
Send me a PM on Discord (_Ruu#9999_) and add me on Steam if you wanna get in on the scorechase!

## ToDo / Asks

- "How To Play" UI that is customised based on the controllers being used. In the Discord, there's some images of how to hold various controllers - these should be ingame! Maybe a gif of gameplay too.
- Custom tagging for scores submitted with Claws enabled. Ideally, this isn't a separate scoreboard, but instead treated as a modifier within the current scoreboard.
- Ingame grip customisation. Adjusting rotation & position is hard to do in files, there should be some way to do it ingame.
- Support for in-map toggling of Claws, for stream integration.
