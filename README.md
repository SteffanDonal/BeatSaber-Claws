Thanks to [ragesaq](https://twitch.tv/ragesaq) for giving me the original mod and idea for this gamemode!

## How to Play

1. Install "Claws" using [ModAssistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant), or [download the latest version](https://github.com/SteffanDonal/BeatSaber-Claws/releases) and unzip manually.
2. In the gameplay settings, under mods, find the "Claws" toggle and enable it!

**Please note:** For now, you will need to create your own controller offsets, as this functionality was broken with the Beat Saber Unity upgrade. It _will_ be back, but for now use the in-game offset preferences please!

### Difficulty

You may find that Claws mod is particularly easy, or hard for you! The difficulty of this mod is largely based on your armspan.

I am 180cm tall, and find the difficulty "just right". You can set SteamVR to scale everything up or down to match me!

Here's how to calculate the correct scale value:
```
Centimeters:
	Your Height รท 180 = SteamVR World Scale
	EG: 150 รท 180 = 0.83 = 83%

Feet:
	Your Height รท 5.9 = SteamVR World Scale
	EG: 4.9 รท 5.9 = 0.83 = 83%
```

Set this in SteamVR's **Video Settings**, you can find it under Beat Saber > Video Settings. You should able to set this with the game open!

### Safety

Claws is hard. Harder than it looks, and it _looks_ hard.

**Please warmup thoroughly before playing Claws**. As someone who has been playing Claws for over 500 hours now, a warmup is _necessary_. Stretch your arms and shoulders, and try not to overuse your elbows or wrists. Take breaks!

Also take extra care not to controller smash ๐คฃ
